## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
In the current project, the 3D volumetric segmentation of heterogeneous brain tumors such as Gliomas- anaplastic
astrocytoma, and Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is performed to extract enhancing tumor (ET), whole tumor
(WT), and tumor core (TC) regions using T1, T2, and FLAIR images

### Project  <a name="project"></a>

Brain tumors are the result of abnormal growth of cells and 
have dismal consequences on the patient’s body. The brain 
tumors are categorized on the pattern of cell development, 
which may be noncancerous in nature and are termed as 
benign, whereas the cancerous one is termed as malignant. 
Benign tumors propagate slowly, which do not spread and 
thus have no afect the associated normal brain parenchyma 
while malignant tumors growth is very rapid and afects 
other parts of brain.
